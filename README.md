# Bikeshare
# Basic Data Exploration with pandas on Bikeshare Data


_A Python project using pandas to explore bikeshare data._

# Project Overview

This project focuses on pandas library usage and simple statistics methods to perform descriptive 
analysis on the bikeshare data from three major U.S. cities - Chicago, Washington, and New York City - 
to display information such as most popular days or most common stations.

### Running the program

I used Atom editor to run this code, you can use any preferred editor to do this.

### Program Details

This project is specially built for bikeshare system, that allows people to rent a bike 
from one station and returns it in another. the aim of this project to calculate some 
statistics about users in a specific city, month and day. Day can be a week day such as 
Tuesday, or a month day as 10. it calculates:

*	The Most Frequent Times of Travel in month, day and hour.
*	The Most Popular Stations and Trip.
*	Trip Duration.
*	Types of users (ex: Subscriber, Customer, etc...)
*	Types of gender.
*	earliest year of birth.
*	
These calculations are so helpful to determine the targeted group for 
each day in the month, which may improve service to eet their needs and increase companyâ€™s earning.

Finally, the user is prompted with the choice of restarting the program or not.
